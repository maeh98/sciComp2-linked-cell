Molecular Dynamics is a problem where a huge amount of point-like bodies, such as atoms or distant galaxies, all interact between each other through some force field.
The naive computation of all these forces is highly computationally intensive. We implemented the Linked-Cell Algorithm in Python in a Jupyter Notebook to have a compuational complexity of O(N).
